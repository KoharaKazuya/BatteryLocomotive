## Motivation

> In the Factorio, the trains are still powered by coal even if the player can launch a rocket and put on a suit that runs on a fusion reactor. Why not run them on electricity? Let's move trains into the electric age!

This MOD is created **only** for electrifying the train system.

Similar MODs.

- [Electric Train](https://mods.factorio.com/mods/magu5026/ElectricTrain)
- [Electronic Locomotives](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/Electronic_Locomotives)

The difference between these

- Adds only locomotives of comparable performance to vanilla so as not to significantly change the game balance
- Simple: Adds the bare minimum items
- No additional chargers are needed, just build the train and charge it

So, if you're looking for an end game that goes beyond vanilla, play with `Electric Train` or `Electronic Locomotives`.

## Feature

Adds three battery locomotives.

When the train is stopped, it is charged as long as it is within range of a electric pole.

Battery locomotives are unlocked by researching specialized technology.
